# Hololearn Hub
Welcome! Maybe you're here because of our [article](https://www.educationandlearning.nl/news/holograms-for-learning) or maybe you've heard us talk somewhere about our dream-like projects.

Hololearn is an idea where students are in a classroom, surrounded by humans, however somehow at the same time they're at home alone! This is the dream we're putting together at the moment. Please contact [Bibeg](b.h.limbu@tudelft.nl) for more information or ideas/collaboration.
