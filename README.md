# Hololearn Hub
Welcome! Maybe you're here because of our [article](https://www.educationandlearning.nl/news/holograms-for-learning) or maybe you've heard us talk somewhere about our dream-like projects.

Hololearn is an idea where students are in a classroom, surrounded by humans, however somehow at the same time they're at home alone! This is the dream we're putting together at the moment. This is a joint initiative between LDECEL(https://www.educationandlearning.nl/), NewMedia Center and the student council. This initiative aims to use holograms to stimulate richer social interactions in online/distance education between students and teachers at TU Delft. The project aims to achieve two major goals.
1. Seamless integration of holograms in current [distance] teaching practices 
2.Explore implications of holograms on social interactions and educational outcomes.
